# 2D platformer engine
### made using Python and Pygame

Just a personal project that I tried to make for fun

## FEATURES
### Player
- Move left and right
- Jump

### Platform

## BUGS
### Platform collision is a bit glitchy at times
- Hugging the side of a 'platform' while holding A or D against the side of the wall while still in the y-axis of the top hitbox will make the 'player' suspend in position.
